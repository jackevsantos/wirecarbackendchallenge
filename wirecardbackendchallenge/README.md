# Wirecard Backend Challenge

This API was created for the Wirecard backend challenge. This is an API that processes payments for a particular purchase.

## Technologies

For the creation of this project were used: 
- Java;
- Spring Boot;
- Maven;
- H2 Database Engine;
- JPA;
- Postman;
- MockMvc;

## Code Style 

The architectural standard used in this project was the MVC.
I also adopted the DAO standard to address the issue of data persistence.
The project architecture is split and works as follows:

- Model:
  - Package responsible for modeling the project entities. In this project the entities were modeled in: 
    - Client;
    - Buyer;
    - Card;
    - Payment;
    - Buy (I chose to create this entity to make the tie between the others. Therefore, a buy would have relationship with customer (wirecard customer that is making the sale), buyer and payment related to it.); [Here](https://github.com/jackevsantos/wirecarbackendchallenge/issues/1) is a diagram showing the relationship of entities.
       
- DAO:
  - Responsible for accessing the database by encapsulating data access, so the other classes do not need to know about it.
- Service:
  - Responsible for running the system business rules.
- Controller:
  - Responsible for the part related to the navigation of the user in the system.
- Handle:
  - It is responsible for the specific treatment of some scenarios.
- Config:
  - Responsible for the general configuration of the system, in this case, the questions of authentication of the API requests.

## Getting Started 

### Prerequisites

To execute the project you need to have it configured on your machine:

- Java 1.8;
- Maven;

### Installation instructions

After cloning the GitHub project in your workspace, you should go to your preferred IDE (in my case I chose [STS](https://spring.io/tools3/sts/all) for the ease it provides to work with projects Spring) and import the project as an Existing Maven Project. And with that you already have the project ready to run!

You'll also need to install [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/downloads/) on your machine. 
With Postman installed, you may have to import the collection with the requests created for this project by [JSON](https://github.com/jackevsantos/wirecardchallenge/blob/master/wirecardChallenge.postman_collection.json) existing in this project or by [here](https://www.getpostman.com/collections/7be73c5439f92e510b56).

To view the API documentation generated by Postman, I suggest that your machine also have [Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/pt-BR/chrome/) installed. 

## Tests

### Automated tests

The automatic tests were also done via Postman, you can rotate them by clicking on the name of the collection wirecardBackendChallenge, then the symbol '' and Run. In the pop up that the postman application opens, you must click the 'Run wirecardBackendChallenge' button. Since the collection has been structured you can also do the same process to run the tests only for a specific entity.

### TDD
To implement TDD, I opted to use the MockMvc framework because of its approach to working with controllers.
To run the TDD implementation, you only need to run the WirecardbackendchallengeApplicationTests class as a JUnit Test.
